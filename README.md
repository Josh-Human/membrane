## General Information

This project was initially part of my MEng disseration, however the focus was on the chemical engineering aspects at that time.
Since then the project has been re-written as a practical learning exercise to aid my understanding of:

-   Object-oriented-design
-   Test driven development
-   Implementing proper documentation

Over time I hope to further improve this work and expand upon it.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Technologies Used

-   pytest - 6.2.5
-   Sphinx - 4.3.2

## Features

List the ready features here:

-   Comprehensive unit testing
-   Full documentation - with Sphinx generated web page
-   Makes use of python features such as:
    -   Descriptors
    -   Fixtures

<!-- ## Screenshots

## Setup

What are the project requirements/dependencies? Where are they listed? A requirements.txt or a Pipfile.lock file perhaps? Where is it located?

Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project.

## Usage

How does one go about using it?
Provide various use cases and code examples here.

## Project Status

Project is: in progress.

## Room for Improvement

Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:

-   Better understanding of when to use 'private' and public attributes
-   Understanding of what makes a good test
    -   e.g had a series of tests for simple getter/setter functions
-   Understanding of project architecture

To do:

-   Refactor membrane object to have keys with value null rather than add on class
-   Improve formatting of Sphinx web page
-   Host documentation online
-   Create additonal models for more complex simulations
